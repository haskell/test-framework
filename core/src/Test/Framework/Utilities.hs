-- | Like 'unlines', but does not append a trailing newline if there

--
-- > unlinesConcise ["A", "B"] == "A\nB"
-- > unlinesConcise [] == ""
--
-- Whereas:
--
-- > unlines ["A", "B"] == "A\nB\n"
-- > unlines [] == ""

-- This is closer to the behaviour of 'unwords', which does not append
-- a trailing space.
