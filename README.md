test-framework
==============

This framework for organizing tests is mature and stable, but it is no longer actively developed.

NEW FEATURE REQUESTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS ARE NO LONGER ACCEPTED!

Old homepage: https://haskell.github.io/test-framework/

New users are encouraged to look into more actively developed test frameworks,
for instance:

- [hspec](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hspec)
- [tasty](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty)

(Developers: if you want to see your test framework listed here, please open a pull request.)
