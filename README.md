test-framework
==============

This framework for organize tests is considered legacy and no longer actively developed.

Old homepage: https://haskell.github.io/test-framework/

New users are encouraged to look into more actively developed test frameworks,
for instance:

- [hspec](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hspec)
- [tasty](https://hackage.haskell.or/package/tasty)

(Developers: if you want to see your test framework listed here, please open a pull request.)
